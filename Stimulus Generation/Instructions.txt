The Create_Skel_Figure.py script will procedurally generate nonsense objects from a skeleton.

################
Creation procedure from the paper
################


Each skeleton will be comprised of three segments created from Bezier curves
of a random size and curvature scaled between .05 and .25 virtual Blender units (vu). The first 
segment will be oriented forward towards the ‘camera’. The second and third segments will be oriented
perpendicular to the first segment and attached to the first segment or second segment at a random
point along their length. 

Surface forms were created by applying a circular bevel to the object’s skeleton along with one of five 
taper properties that determined the shape of the surface form. 

The overall size of the object will be normalized to .25 vu

#################
Best practices
#################

This script does not incorporate any collision detection when attaching and manipulating skeletal segments. Thus, a segment may overlap with another segment or
bend into itself.

The best method to use this script is to create a large set of objects using the default parameters and then go through the created images and keep only those  
objects that do not have overlapping or deformed segments.


################
To Run
################

From the command prompt:

1. CD to the root folder:
	
	cd ...\Skeletal-obj-recog\Stimulus Generation\

2. Run the script
	
	blender.exe Base_File.blend --background --python Create_Skel_Figure.py <number of figures> <take picture> <deformation value>


<number of figures> This argument specifies how many objects you want to create. Default is 5.

<take picture> This argument specifies whether the script should generate images of the objects. 
Put 1 if you want to take pictures. 0 if you don't want pictures.

<Deformation value> This argument will adjust how much the object segments will vary. A larger value will lead to greater variability.
Default is .15.

Example:
	
	blender.exe Base_File.blend --background --python Create_Skel_Figure.py 50 1 .12
