This folder contains all of the stimuli used in the paper. The contents of each sub-folder is described below.

Blender Files - All of the raw 3D .blend files from which the stimuli were made. See the "Stimulus Generation Folder" for instructions on how to create your own 3D figures.

Experiment 1 - The 450 stimuli used in Experiment 1 (30 skeletons x 5 surfaces forms x 3 orientations). 

Description from the paper:
	" Objects were procedurally generated using the Python API for Blender
	(Blender Foundation). Each skeleton was comprised of three segments created from Bezier curves
	of a random size and curvature scaled between .05 and .25 virtual Blender units (vu). The first axis
	segment was oriented forward towards the ‘camera’. The second and third segments were oriented
	perpendicular to the first segment and attached to the first segment or second segment at a random
	point along their length. Surface forms were created by applying a circular bevel to the object’s
	skeleton along with one of five taper properties that determined the shape of the surface form.
	Finally, the overall size of the object was normalized to .25 vu."

Experiment 2 - The 72 stimuli used in Experiment 2 (3 skeleton base pairs x 5 skeletal variations x 3 orientaitons). Each base pair was generated with 5 degrees of similarity, 0% to 50% difference from the base pair.

Description from the paper:
	" A k-means cluster analysis was conducted on
	participants’ discrimination data from Experiment 1. This analysis revealed that objects were well
	described by four clusters. Based on these clusters, three perceptually matched objects were
	chosen whose skeletons could be altered without changing the coarse spatial relations (see
	Supplemental Figure 2). Importantly, these objects also had different coarse spatial relations (Set 1:
	two components below a third, pointing down, one component placed in front of the other; Set 2:
	one component on either side of a third, one pointing up and the other down; Set 3: one component
	on either side of a third, each pointing diagonally down). Six versions of each object (0%, 10%, 20%,
	30%, 40%, and 50% skeleton difference) were generated by moving one segment along the length
	of the central segment in 10% increments (relative to the length of the central component). Objects
	were rendered with only the thinnest surface form to prevent component parts from overlapping.
	Images of each object (18 total) were generated in three orientations (30°, 60°, 90°) intended to
	maximize the view of each object. Each object was analyzed and compared with every other object
	using the same models and procedure described in Experiment 1."


Experiment 3 - The 60 stimuli used in the Experiment 3 (4 skeletons x 5 surface forms x 3 orientations). This folder also includes images from other orientations.

Description from the paper:
	"Four perceptually matched objects were chosen from
	the object clusters identified in Experiment 2. Images of each object (4 objects × 5 surface forms)
	were generated in three orientations (30°, 60°, 90°) intended to maximize the view of each object"

Skeletons - Contains the 3D skeleton coordinate files from Experiments 1 and 2 as CSVs, as well as scripts to compute skeletal similarity.
