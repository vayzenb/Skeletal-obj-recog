Sub-folder description

Blender Files - All of the raw 3D .blend files from which the stimuli were made. See the "Stimulus Generation Folder" for instructions on how to create your own 3D figures.

Experiment 1 - The 450 stimuli used in Experiment 1 (30 skeletons x 5 surfaces forms x 3 orientations). 

Experiment 2 - The 72 stimuli used in Experiment 2 (3 skeleton base pairs x 5 skeletal variations x 3 orientaitons). Each base pair was generated with 5 degrees of similarity, 0% to 50% difference from the base pair.

Experiment 3 - The 60 stimuli used in the Experiment 3 (4 skeletons x 5 surface forms x 3 orientations). This folder also includes images from other orientations.

Skeletons - Contains the 3D skeleton coordinate files from Experiments 1 and 2 as CSVs, as well as scripts to compute skeletal similarity.
